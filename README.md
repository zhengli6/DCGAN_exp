# DCGAN_exp
This is an exploration of various settings on the performance of DCGAN. This project is a term project in class CSE8696 Neural Network and Machine learning.  

In this project, we tested and manipulated a few GAN training "tricks" and examine the different BN settings to see how it affects the final result. The model was written in Python and trained using cifar-10 datasets.
